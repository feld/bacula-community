/*
 * ProgressCounter is useful to remotely monitor the progress, or cancel a "process"
 *
 * - The progress object can be created an passed to function/objects to monitor
 *   the progress from another function.
 * - For example a progress object is passed to any function involved in the
 *   dedup vacuum and used by "dedup usage" to report the vacuum progress or
 *   "dedup vacuum cancel" to cancel the vacuum.
 * - You must initialize the "goal" at the beginning of every part and maintain
 *   the "current" using  inc_progress() or set_progress()
 * - use get_progress() to retrieve the "current" and "goal" values
 * - A "state" can also be used when the process requires different sub-process
 * - use set_canceled() and is_canceled() to change and query the "cancel" status
 * - every time the "current" is updated, the time is recorded in "last_t"
 *   it can be compared with "start_t" (when the object was created or reset)
 *   or with "intermediate_t" when using "state"
